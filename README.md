## Effects of Costs on Returns

With everyone responsible for funding theri own retirement, it is important to make sound financial decisions. Many retail investors do not fully understand the long term effects of even small differences in costs on returns between different assets.  

You can explore this relationship using this tool. Just enter the following figures:  
1. an initial investment amount;  
2. the estimated long run average rate of return for the investment; and  
3. the year you intend to recoup your returns.
